<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>You have eight questions of 5 marks each. You need to attempt all. </em></li>
<li><em>Download the files and save them on your desktop.</em></li>
<li><em>Open a new excel workbook and save it in your roll number, e.g. ECON01. For backlog candidates you can save it as BL-ECON01 </em></li>
<li><em>For example if you are solving question 1 then copy the data and paste/save it to sheet 1 of ECON01 workbook. Similarly, for Q2 copy-paste the data in sheet 2 of the workbook ECON01. Rename the worksheets 1 &amp; 2 as Q1 and Q2 respectively. Do this for the rest. </em></li>
<li><em>At the end save your workbook and email (<a href="mailto:pravesh.econ@presiuniv.ac.in" class="email">pravesh.econ@presiuniv.ac.in</a>) it to me. Note that you will have just one workbook to send to.</em></li>

<p>Answer the following: [<span class="math inline">\(8\times5 = 40\)</span>]</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You are thinking of advertising Microsoft products on a sports telecast. As you buy more ads, the price of each ad decreases as shown in the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Number.of.ads</th>
<th align="left">Price.per.ad</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">1-5</td>
<td align="left">$12,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">6-10</td>
<td align="left">$11,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">11-20</td>
<td align="left">$10,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">21 and higher</td>
<td align="left">$9,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, if you buy 8 ads, you pay <code>$11,000</code> per ad, but if you buy 14 ads, you pay <code>$10,000</code> per ad. Write a formula that yields the total cost of purchasing any number of ads.</p></li>
<li><p>You are given (in the <a href="Deming.xlsx">Deming.xlsx</a> file) the measured diameter (in inches) for 500 rods produced by Rodco, as reported by the production foreman. A rod is considered acceptable if it is at least 1 inch in diameter. In the past, the diameter of the rods produced by Rodco has followed a symmetric histogram:<br>
• Construct a histogram of these measurements.<br>
• Comment on any unusual aspects of the histogram.<br>
Can you guess what might have caused any unusual aspects of the histogram? (Hint: One of quality-guru Edwards Deming’s 14 points is to “Drive out fear.”)</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="Cakes.xlsx">Cakes.xlsx</a> file contains the number of salespeople and revenue for a bakery for each month. Use this data for problems a to d:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Create a combination chart with a secondary axis to summarize monthly salespeople and revenues.</li>
<li>Graph monthly revenue and insert data labels on the chart.</li>
<li>Graph the number of salespeople and insert a data table below the chart.</li>
<li>Plot monthly sales by using a cake chart rather than a column chart.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The following questions relate to the data <a href="temp.txt">temp.txt</a> (to download right click and save link):</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Choose one month and plot a line chart with average temperature anomaly on the vertical axis and time (from 1880 to the latest year available) on the horizontal axis. Label each axis and give a suitable title to your chart.</li>
<li>The columns labeled ‘DJF’, ‘MAM’, ‘JJA’, and ‘SON’ contain seasonal averages (means). For example, the ‘MAM’ column contains the average of the March, April, and May columns for each year. Plot a separate line chart for each season, using average temperature anomaly for that season on the vertical axis and time (from 1880 to the latest year available) on the horizontal axis.</li>
<li>The column labeled <strong>J-D</strong> contains the average temperature anomaly for each year. Plot a line chart with annual average temperature anomaly on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. Your chart should look like the figure below.
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:1"></span>

</div>
Add a horizontal line that intersects the vertical axis at 0, and label it ‘1951-1980 average’.</li>
<li>What do your charts from the above questions suggest about the relationship between temperature and time?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
