<h2>2.1 Data transformation</h2>
<p>In this lecture we shall cover: Data transformation: arithmetic operation- addition, subtraction, multiplication, log transformation, exponential, squaring and square root, indices. Along with these topics we shall also discuss copy-paste and transpose cells with an example as an extension/supplement to the earlier lecture.</p>

Each unit of the drug sells for <span class="math inline">\(\$12\)</span> and incurs variable costs of <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span>. The drug will be sold for 10 years. Develop a worksheet that computes the company’s 10-year profit, given the chosen annual capacity level and the annual demand for the drug. Assume demand for the drug is the same each year. You can ignore the time value of money in this problem.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Number.of.ads</th>
<th align="left">Price.per.ad</th>
