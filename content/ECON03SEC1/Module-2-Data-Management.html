<h2>2.1 Data transformation</h2>
<p>In this lecture we shall cover: Data transformation: arithmetic operation- addition, subtraction, multiplication, log transformation, exponential, squaring and square root, indices. Along with these topics we shall also discuss copy-paste and transpose cells with an example as an extension/supplement to the earlier lecture.</p>

<li>A major drug company is trying to determine the correct plant capacity for a new drug. A unit of annual capacity can be built for a cost of <span class="math inline">\(\$10\)</span>. Each unit of the drug sells for <span class="math inline">\(\$12\)</span> and incurs variable costs of <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span>. The drug will be sold for 10 years. Develop a worksheet that computes the company’s 10-year profit, given the chosen annual capacity level and the annual demand for the drug. Assume demand for the drug is the same each year. You can ignore the time value of money in this problem.</li>

<li>Download video practice file <a href="Lookup.xlsx">Lookup.xlsx</a></li>
<li>Exercise:
<ul>
<li>You are thinking of advertising Microsoft products on a sports telecast. As you buy more ads, the price of each ad decreases as shown in the following table:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Number.of.ads</th>
<th align="left">Price.per.ad</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">1-5</td>
<td align="left">$12,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">6-10</td>
<td align="left">$11,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">11-20</td>
<td align="left">$10,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">21 and higher</td>
<td align="left">$9,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, if you buy 8 ads, you pay <code>$11,000</code> per ad, but if you buy 14 ads, you pay <code>$10,000</code> per ad. Write a formula that yields the total cost of purchasing any number of ads.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Lookupmultiplecolumns.xlsx">Lookupmultiplecolumns.xlsx</a> file contains information about several sales made at an electronics store. A salesperson’s name will be entered in B17. Write an Excel formula that can be copied from C17 to D17:F17 that extracts each salesperson’s radio sales to C17, TV sales to D17, printer sales to E17, and CD sales to F17.</li>
