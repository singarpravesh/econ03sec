- Download the file [Historicalinvest.xlsx](Historicalinvest.xlsx) that is used in the video and practice.
- Exercise:
    - Use the [States.xlsx](States.xlsx) file to calculate the total sales in Arizona, California, Montana, New York, and New Jersey. Compute the total sales in a form such as AZ+CA+MT+NY+NJ instead of SUM(A21:A25).

## 1.2 Lookup functions.

- Exercise:
    - You are thinking of advertising Microsoft products on a sports telecast. As you buy more ads, the price of each ad decreases as shown in the following table:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
data.frame(`Number of ads` = c("1-5", "6-10", "11-20", "21 and higher"),
           `Price per ad` = c("$12,000","$11,000", "$10,000", "$9,000")) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```
      For example, if you buy 8 ads, you pay `$11,000` per ad, but if you buy 14 ads, you pay `$10,000` per ad. Write a formula that yields the total cost of purchasing any number of ads.
