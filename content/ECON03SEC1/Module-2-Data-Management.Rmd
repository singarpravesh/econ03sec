## 2.1 Data transformation
In this lecture we shall cover: Data transformation: arithmetic operation- addition, subtraction, multiplication, log transformation, exponential, squaring and square root, indices. Along with these topics we shall also discuss copy-paste and transpose cells with an example as an extension/supplement to the earlier lecture.

- Download the file [Pastespecial.xlsx](Pastespecial.xlsx) that is used in the video and practice.
- Exercise:
    - The [Mavs.xlsx](Mavs.xlsx) file contains statistics for the great 2002–2003 Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Player names are listed in column A, statistical categories are listed in row 3, and statistical results are listed in rows 4–20. Change the worksheet so that all player names are listed in the same row and all statistical categories are listed in the same column.
    - The [Productpaste.xlsx](Productpaste.xlsx) file contains data on quarterly sales for four products. Copy this data to another range so that quarterly sales are read across instead of down. Link your copied data to the original data so that your computation of annual sales in the copied data range reflect changes entered in rows 5–8.
    
## 2.2 Importing and editing data from text files/documents.
This lecture will focus on importing data from text files and editing text data to perform mathematical operations.

## 2.2 Creating named ranges.
In this lecture video we shall talk about creating named ranges and operations on named ranges.

- Download the file [Historicalinvest.xlsx](Historicalinvest.xlsx) that is used in the video and practice.
- Exercise:
    - Use the [States.xlsx](States.xlsx) file to calculate the total sales in Arizona, California, Montana, New York, and New Jersey. Compute the total sales in a form such as AZ+CA+MT+NY+NJ instead of SUM(A21:A25).

## 2.3 Lookup functions.
In this video we shall talk about the `VLOOKUP()` function.

- Download video practice file [Lookup.xlsx](Lookup.xlsx)
- Exercise:
    - You are thinking of advertising Microsoft products on a sports telecast. As you buy more ads, the price of each ad decreases as shown in the following table:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
data.frame(`Number of ads` = c("1-5", "6-10", "11-20", "21 and higher"),
           `Price per ad` = c("$12,000","$11,000", "$10,000", "$9,000")) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```
      
  For example, if you buy 8 ads, you pay `$11,000` per ad, but if you buy 14 ads, you pay `$10,000` per ad. Write a formula that yields the total cost of purchasing any number of ads.
  
  - The [Lookupmultiplecolumns.xlsx](Lookupmultiplecolumns.xlsx) file contains information about several sales made at an electronics store. A salesperson’s name will be entered in B17. Write an Excel formula that can be copied from C17 to D17:F17 that extracts each salesperson’s radio sales to C17, TV sales to D17, printer sales to E17, and CD sales to F17.
