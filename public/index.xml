      <description>Instructions:
You have eight questions of 5 marks each. You need to attempt all. Download the files and save them on your desktop.Open a new excel workbook and save it in your roll number, e.g. ECON01. For backlog candidates you can save it as BL-ECON01 For example if you are solving question 1 then copy the data and paste/save it to sheet 1 of ECON01 workbook. Similarly, for Q2 copy-paste the data in sheet 2 of the workbook ECON01.</description>

3.2 Multivariate data
3.1 Univariate dataIn this lecture video we shall cover the Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Dispersion, treatment of outliers,rank with and without ties, and Moments and Order Statistics.
In the above video i.e. Part 2, please note that the explanation for TRIMMEAN() function will hold true only if I had sorted the data in ascending or descending form. Else the explanation is that trim mean is calculated by deleting the x number of highest and the lowest values, and NOT the top or bottom values in an un-sorted/any random data series.</description>

      <description>This project is based on the content and materials of (www.core-econ.org) 
Project: The behaviour of average surface temperature over timeIn this project we shall consider the data from NASA about land-ocean temperature anomalies in the northern hemisphere. Figure 1 is constructed using this data and shows temperatures in northern hemisphere over the period 1880-2019, expressed as differences from the average temperature from 1951-1980.
