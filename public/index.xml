      <description>We shall use Microsoft Excel 2013 during the course. So I would suggest the class to install the 2013 version in their computers.Go through the syllabus uploaded in the university website.The reference book is Microsoft Excel 2013: Data Analysis and Business Modeling by Wayne L. Winston.What should you know before reading this book?Formulas should begin with an \(=\) sign.\(*\) is used for multiplication, \(/\) for division, \(^\) is used to raise a quantity to a power.</description>
